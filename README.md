# The Alchemists ðŸ§ª

Welcome to The Alchemists' project repository for the Lux Capital Bio x ML Hackathon!

## Project Overview

This repository contains our work on translating a Jupyter notebook into a set of Python modules that can be called from scripts. We're exploring the intersection of biology and machine learning to create innovative solutions.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Contains project documentation
  - [About the Data](docs/about_the_data.md): Information about the dataset
  - [Using RunPod](docs/using_runpod.md): Instructions for using RunPod
  - [Virtual Environment Instructions](docs/virtual-env-instructions.md): Guide for setting up a virtual environment
- `data/`: Directory for storing project data
  - `raw/`: Subdirectory for raw data files
    - `enveda_library_subset.parquet`: The original dataset file (to be downloaded)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a virtual environment using Poetry. Instructions can be found [here](docs/virtual-env-instructions.md).
3. Download the original data file to `data/raw/enveda_library_subset.parquet`.

## Data
